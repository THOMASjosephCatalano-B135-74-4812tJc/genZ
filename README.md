a p2p like open or closed connected networked systems(hardware and/or software) 
that combines and not limited to and from a input or output source(for example IoT, 
www internet and not limited to unknown transmissions that are yet not classified.);;
and its data can be used or loged by a median or mechanism for stand alone or parallel storage, playblack, calculations, hyperledger and/or like combined operations ;;
