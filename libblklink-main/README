 // about genz-core


a p2p connected networked systems(hardware and/or software) 
that combines and not limited to and from a input or output source(for example; IoT, 
www/http/https internet and not limited to unknown transmissions that are yet not classified);;
and its data can be used or loged by a median or mechanism for stand alone or parallel storage, playblack, calculations, hyperledger and/or like combined operations ;;

-in conjuction it may perform one or more task:

secure system calculations of network, data and/or like objects with managment of all systems and process's;;

securly allocate compute, power, or like recources(networks, data and like objects)for parrallel and concurrent task scheduling if needed;;

unallocated recources are used to process functions in a secure manner(hashes for example)predescribed by the system and/or group;;

return a value that calculates return yield of energy concpumtion of entire system based on(
all avaliable data / time *function = n ) for a return of x for used process's;;
